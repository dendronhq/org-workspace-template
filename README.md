# Engineering Team Workspace Template

This template helps get you started with using Dendron inside an engineering team.

It is divided into two vaults:
- [private](./org-private/notes/root.md): company internal information (eg. roadmap, projects, meetings)
- [public](./org-public/notes/root.md): public information (eg. wiki, blog, faq)
- [dev](./org-dev/notes/root.md): engineering specific  (eg. coding guidelines, docs, rfcs)
